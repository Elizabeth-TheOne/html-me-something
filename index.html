                    305 Morgan was built c. 1865 in the Italianate Villa style. It was the first home to have a 
                    bathtub installed. It has three full stories, large porch, and parquet flooring. The most 
                    interesting outbuilding is the log cabin.

                   731 N. 5th has an interesting foot print. The house is two rectangles meeting at an 
                   angle.  In 1910 it was two apartments and remained that way for many years.The current 
                   owners restored it to one home.

                        There were so many gorgeous homes it was challenging to choose one above the rest. It
                         was a wonderful day and a fun way to exercise.  Maybe they will have a Victorian 
                         Christmas tour.
